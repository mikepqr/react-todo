# Todo in React

[Live demo](https://mikepqr.github.io/react-todo/)

I converted an [Angular hello world
demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuiHuZq_cg4) to React.

 - Serve locally: `npm start`
 - Deploy to github pages: `npm run deploy`

You can see [a subset of the stuff I
read](https://pinboard.in/u:mike/t:reactjs/) for this on pinboard.
